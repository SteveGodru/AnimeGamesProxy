# AnimeGamesProxy - Anime Games Proxy Module for Android 

## Introduction 
Anime Games Proxy Module for Android, used to redirect game requests to a specific private service.

## List of supported games 

- **Aquamarine Files** (Japanese & International) 
  - Disable Anti-cheat 
- **Tomorrow's Ark** (Chinese only) 
  - Disable NetWorkConfig checking 
- **Naruto** (lack of testing) 
- **Harajuku**

- **Jedi Zero** (RSAPatch only for CN2.0 & CN2.1 & OS2.1) 
- **Wipeout: Star Dome** Railroad

contains a bypass of most of the detection of the built-in ACE anti-cheat handbook, the main purpose of which is to allow tampering with apk packages in order to connect to the private service, which means you may not be able to use it to cheat in the official service.

This module does not support working in PC emulators, which means that some of its functions are disabled.
